# SpeCs: Spectrogram correlated stacking

It is a novel method of detecting/extracting the stochastic gravitational wave background signal. SpeCs goes beyond the usual cross-correlation (and to higher frequencies) by exploiting the higher-order statistics in the time-frequency domain which accounts for the \textit{chirping} nature of the individual events that comprise SGWB. We show that \texttt{SpeCs} improves the signal-to-noise for the detection of SGWB by a factor close to, compared to standard optimal cross-correlation methods which are tuned to measure only the power spectrum of the SGWB signal.
